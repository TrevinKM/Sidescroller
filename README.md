SideScroller

Here as part of a collaborative group we have created a multiplayer sidescroller game using Java. Within this project I worked alongside 4 other team members to create a game using the JSFML library. From this, I was able to learn crucial lessons on collaborative development. Moreover, I was able to single-handedly implement an interactive menu system and a button class as part of the OOP structure I used, this meant that I was able to extend on the functionality provided by the library.
